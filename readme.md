AbstractKnowledge gathering using discussion, is the best efficient way among the students. In present most of the students rely on internet for gathering information while the main problem of current search features is university students are unable to answer the questions and discuss the past examination papers by using uploaded pdf file. The research has been conducted to develop a software solution to overcome above existing problem. Consequently, collaborative examination paper discussion platform was designed. This solution includes five main modules namely, Administration Module, Data Analytical Module, User Profile Management Module, Document Handling Module and Discussion Forum. Administration module which covers fundamental functionalities related to administrative purpose. Data Analytical analyses the data that are collected from the discussion forum while it helps for system admin to find out on going learning patterns. User Profile Management module consists of registration unit, logging unit, profile display unit and profile edit unit that are given user to capability of maintaining their own profiles. Document handling module has file uploading unit and tagging unit while Discussion forum provides an area for user to add comments, answers, and images. When considering about the overall system, there are three types of users, student, lecturers and administrators. Inputs of the system are Examination papers in PDF, Images, Documents, User details, answers, and comments. Outputs in our approach are related answers and comments for questions. PDF file convert into images, retrieve data from database, output related answers are considered as process. The overall system has been developed to run on Windows. The proposed system has some special features which are not available in other existing systems such as answering questions using pdf and uploading a pdf file. The system was evaluated, using questionnaire and module testing.
